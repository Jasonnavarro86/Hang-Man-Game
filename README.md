# Hang-Man-Game

On this project I am hoping to create an awesome hangman game that my two sons will love. 

I have put all of their heros into the game and have created a fun version where anytime you guess the right hero an alert will pop up with a message saying the enemy has been defeated and the good guys get a point, and viceversa if you don't guess the name the bad guys defeat your hero and the get the point.
